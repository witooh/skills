description: Interact with GitLab via the glab CLI. Primary use case is MR review — fetches the diff, runs parallel code review + security review via specialist agents, then posts the result as a Thai comment on the MR. Also supports listing MRs, viewing MR status, checking CI/CD pipelines, approving MRs, and other glab operations. Trigger whenever the user provides a GitLab MR URL or says anything like "review MR", "ช่วย review MR นี้", "ดู MR ให้หน่อย", "review https://gitlab.../merge_requests/42", "check pipeline", "list open MRs", or any GitLab-related task. Also trigger when the user wants to fix issues from a MR — e.g. "แก้ตาม MR นี้", "fix MR", "แก้ issue ตาม MR", "แก้ MR <url>", "แก้ตาม review", or any combination of a GitLab MR URL with fix/แก้ intent. In this case, run the MR Fix workflow (review then auto-chain to /neo-team for implementation).

# GitLab Skill

Use the `glab` CLI to interact with GitLab. The primary workflow is MR Review — but this skill handles any GitLab operation the user needs.

## URL Parsing

When given a GitLab MR URL like `https://gitlab.com/group/subgroup/project/-/merge_requests/42`:

- **repo_ref**: strip `https://` and everything from `/-/` onward → `gitlab.com/group/subgroup/project`
- **mr_id**: extract the number after `merge_requests/` → `42`

These two values power most glab commands: `glab mr <cmd> <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref>`

## Intent Detection

When given a GitLab MR URL, determine the user's intent before selecting a workflow:

| Signal in User Request | Workflow |
|------------------------|----------|
| "review", "ดู", "check", "ตรวจ", no action verb (just URL) | **MR Review** — review only, post findings as comment |
| "แก้", "fix", "แก้ตาม", "แก้ issue", "implement", "ทำตาม" | **MR Fix** — review first, then auto-chain to /neo-team to implement fixes |

**Decision rule:** If the user's message contains both a GitLab MR URL and a fix/แก้ keyword, route to **MR Fix**. If only a review keyword or just a bare URL, route to **MR Review**. When ambiguous, default to **MR Review** (safer — review doesn't change code).

---

## MR Review Workflow

When the user asks to review a MR (or intent is detected as "review"), run this pipeline:

```
1. Fetch MR info, diff, and existing comments
2. Read & summarize existing comments (understand what's already discussed)
3. code-reviewer + security + qa → review in PARALLEL (with comment context)
4. Compose Thai comment from template
5. Post comment to the MR
```

### Step 1: Fetch

```bash
glab mr view <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref> --output json
glab mr diff <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref>
glab mr note list <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref>
```

Extract from the view output: MR title, source branch, target branch, author.

### Step 2: Read Existing Comments

Before diving into the review, read through all existing MR comments/notes fetched in Step 1. This gives crucial context — other reviewers may have already flagged issues, the author may have explained design decisions, or there may be ongoing discussions that affect how you should review. Summarize the key points:

- Issues already raised by other reviewers
- Author's explanations or decisions
- Unresolved discussions that need attention
- Resolved items (avoid duplicating feedback)

This prevents the review from repeating what's already been said and helps focus on gaps that haven't been addressed yet.

### Step 3: Parallel Review

Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` if available (for conventions). Then spawn all three agents at the same time, including a summary of existing comments so reviewers have full context:

```
Agent(
  description: "Code review MR diff",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: """
[code-reviewer agent instructions — read from ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer.agent.md]

---
## Project Conventions
[relevant sections from CLAUDE.md if available, else omit]

---
## Existing MR Comments
[summary of existing comments from Step 2 — issues raised, author explanations, unresolved discussions]
Do NOT repeat issues that other reviewers have already flagged unless you have additional insight to add.

---
## Task
Review the following MR diff for convention compliance.

MR: !<mr_id> — <mr_title>
Branch: <source> → <target>

## Diff
<full diff output>
"""
)

Agent(
  description: "Security review MR diff",
  subagent_type: "security",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: """
[security agent instructions — read from ~/.claude/agents/security.agent.md]

---
## Existing MR Comments
[summary of existing comments from Step 2 — issues raised, author explanations, unresolved discussions]
Do NOT repeat security concerns that have already been raised unless you have additional findings.

---
## Task
Security review the following MR diff.

MR: !<mr_id> — <mr_title>
Branch: <source> → <target>

## Diff
<full diff output>
"""
)

Agent(
  description: "QA review MR diff",
  subagent_type: "qa",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: """
[qa agent instructions — read from ~/.claude/agents/qa.agent.md]

---
## Project Conventions
[relevant sections from CLAUDE.md if available, else omit]

---
## Existing MR Comments
[summary of existing comments from Step 2 — issues raised, author explanations, unresolved discussions]
Do NOT repeat QA concerns that have already been raised unless you have additional findings.

---
## Task
QA review the following MR diff. Focus on:
- Test coverage gaps (are new code paths tested?)
- Missing edge case tests
- Regression risks
- Acceptance criteria validation (if available)

MR: !<mr_id> — <mr_title>
Branch: <source> → <target>

## Diff
<full diff output>
"""
)
```

Read the agent files from `~/.claude/agents/` before spawning, so the full agent instructions are included in the prompt.

### Step 4: Compose Thai comment

Read [references/mr-review-template.md](references/mr-review-template.md) and fill in findings from all three agents (code-reviewer, security, qa).

### Step 5: Post

```bash
glab mr note <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref> -m "<thai_comment>"
```

If `glab` is not authenticated or fails, output the review in the conversation instead and tell the user.

---

## MR Fix Workflow

When intent is detected as "fix" (user wants to fix issues from a MR), run review first then auto-chain to /neo-team for implementation.

```
1. Fetch MR info, diff, and existing comments          (same as MR Review Step 1)
2. Read & summarize existing comments                   (same as MR Review Step 2)
3. code-reviewer + security + qa → review in PARALLEL   (same as MR Review Step 3)
4. Compile findings into structured handoff context
5. Invoke /neo-team via Skill tool with findings
6. Post summary comment on MR (after fix is done)
```

### Steps 1-3: Same as MR Review

Run the exact same fetch → read comments → parallel review pipeline. The only difference is what happens after.

**Important for MR Fix:** When composing the agent prompts in Step 3, add this instruction to each agent:

> Categorize every finding with a severity level: **Blocker**, **Critical**, **Warning**, or **Info**. Format each finding as: `[Severity] file:line — description`. This structured output is required for the handoff to the fix pipeline.

### Step 4: Compile Findings for Handoff

After all three review agents return, compile their findings into a structured context for /neo-team:

```
## MR Fix Context

**MR:** !<mr_id> — <mr_title>
**Branch:** <source_branch> → <target_branch>
**Repository:** <repo_ref>

### Review Findings

#### Code Review Findings
<code_reviewer_output — full findings with severity levels>

#### Security Findings
<security_output — full findings with severity levels>

#### QA Findings
<qa_output — full findings with severity levels>

### Severity Summary
| Level | Count |
|-------|-------|
| Blocker | X |
| Critical | X |
| Warning | X |
| Info | X |

### MR Diff
<full diff for reference>
```

Only proceed to Step 5 if there are **Blocker or Critical** findings. If all findings are Warning/Info only:
1. Post the review comment on the MR (using the MR Review template from Step 4-5 of the Review workflow)
2. Inform the user in the conversation: "ไม่พบ Blocker/Critical — findings ทั้งหมดเป็น Warning/Info เท่านั้น ไม่จำเป็นต้องแก้ไขเร่งด่วน"
3. **End the workflow here.** Do NOT invoke /neo-team. The user can manually request fixes if desired.

### Step 5: Invoke /neo-team

Use the `Skill` tool to invoke /neo-team with the compiled findings:

```
Skill(
  skill_name: "neo-team",
  prompt: """
  แก้ไขโค้ดตาม review findings จาก MR

  <compiled findings from Step 4>

  ## Instructions
  - Fix all Blocker and Critical findings
  - Address Warning findings where practical
  - Info findings are optional improvements
  - The MR diff is provided for context — the code is already in the working directory
  - After fixing, run existing tests to verify nothing is broken
  """
)
```

/neo-team will classify this as a **Bug Fix** workflow internally and run:
1. system-analyzer → understand the codebase + findings
2. developer + qa + code-reviewer → implement fixes + test + verify (3-WAY PARALLEL)
3. Remediation if needed

### Step 6: Post Summary Comment

After /neo-team completes, post a summary comment on the MR:

```bash
glab mr note <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref> -m "<summary_comment>"
```

The comment should follow this format:

```
## 🤖 MR Fix Summary

**MR:** !<mr_id> — <mr_title>

### สิ่งที่แก้ไข
<list of fixes applied, mapped to original findings>

### สถานะ
- Blocker: X/Y แก้แล้ว
- Critical: X/Y แก้แล้ว
- Warning: X/Y แก้แล้ว

**ผลลัพธ์:** ✅ แก้ไขเสร็จ / ⚠️ แก้ไขบางส่วน (ดูรายละเอียดด้านบน)

## Common glab Operations

Use these directly via `Bash` when the user asks for something other than a full review:

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List open MRs | `glab mr list --repo <repo_ref>` |
| View MR details | `glab mr view <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref>` |
| Approve MR | `glab mr approve <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref>` |
| Check pipeline status | `glab ci status --repo <repo_ref>` |
| List pipelines | `glab ci list --repo <repo_ref>` |
| Retry a job | `glab ci retry <job_id> --repo <repo_ref>` |
| Add a note/comment | `glab mr note <mr_id> --repo <repo_ref> -m "<text>"` |

For `--repo`, you can omit it if you're already inside the project directory (glab detects the remote automatically).

## Error Handling

- **glab not authenticated**: tell the user to run `glab auth login`
- **glab command fails**: output the review as conversation text instead of posting, explain what failed
- **Empty diff**: note that the MR has no file changes and skip the review agents
- **Large diff (>500 lines)**: warn the user, proceed but note the review may miss details
